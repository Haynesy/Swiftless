/*
    Window Reshaping
    
    Projection Matrix ( 4x4 ):
        Used to map a 3D scene to a 2D plane ( Color Buffer )
        Requires    - Angle in degrees of our FOV ( Field of view )
                    - Aspect Ratio of our 2D rendering plane
                    - Near and Far planes that bound the render
    
    Model View Matrix ( Transformation Matrix ):
        Used to place geometry ( location and rotation ) at any given time.
        
    Texture Matrix:
        Used to position and rotatre textures in much the same was as the 
        Model View Matrix ( You usually wont touch it )

Compile:
	g++ Window-002.cpp -lglut -lGLU -o Window
